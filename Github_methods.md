| Liveness Detection using Color texture analysis    |  It **takes in an image, performs image space converison, develops individual histograms, performs histogram concatenation** and Finally, the binary classification is performed using **SVM**  | Uses Color Texture analyses for Anti-Spoofing detection                                    | Implemented in C++, exploits the joint color texture information from the luminance and the chrominance channels by extracting low-level feature descriptions from different color spaces | https://github.com/wuyongchn/Face-Spoofing-Detection-or-Face-Liveness-Detection     | ![image](/uploads/7a4e300d5754f3dd43392d50fb13c800/image.png) |
| Combination of Standard Techniques based analysis    | It takes the image as the input. It uses the **Landmark technique which marks specific points in the face and later uses this transformation to classify people**. Since everybody will have a different distance between two eyes, it treats this measurement as embedding and if they are too close to each other in the multidimensional space, we can they are the same person and vice versa.   | Uses Keras, OpenCV, and face_recogniition library                                                    | Consists of pre-trained model uses standard techniques and displays liveness score on-screen when run                                                                                        | https://github.com/AhmetHamzaEmra/Intelegent_Lock |  |

| Face anti-spoofing pre-trained model    |  The **videos used for training are split into frames. These frames are in RGB and they are passed to a ResNet18 model. Also, rPPG features are extracted from these frames and passed to a Dense layer**. These two models are then merged together. While testing the live images are passed to the pre-trained model, when a face is detected, the frame with rPPG are passed to the model and the prediction result is calculated.  | Keras based model to detect spoofing                                                       | Here frames are passed to ResNet18 model, the results can be tested using live photos from webcam (Implemented in Python)                                                                 | https://github.com/Emadeldeen-24/face-anti-spoofing                                 |
| Landmark detection and blinking based analysis      | First, it **detects the landmark values** of the face found in the image. Then, those values are analyzed in order to **determine how they change over time according to a series of face expressions the person is asked to do in front of the camera**, like opening their mouth or blinking. The **printed or digital face photos would produce minimum changes** in the landmarks values, only the location of face marks would change but not the face expression itself, the result of this is an **initial decision if the face is real or not**. On the otherhand, **the original image is used as the input of the Deep Learning CNN** and this returns a **second decision**. Finally, using these 2 initial decisions, we take the average value and then round it       | Transfer Learning Model on VGG16, ResNet 50 architecture with ImageNet weights and FaceNet | Contains the weights and python file for implementation                                                                                                                                   | https://github.com/renatocastro33/Transfer-Learning-Face-Anti-Spoofing-Attack-Model |
